# RNN-LFP
RNN for LFP Prediction

*    Simple LSTM prediction model to try and predict next 10ms of local field potential data
*    Loads LFP from *A1_Post_Sleep.mat* a sleep recording from dCA1 of hippocampus

**LFP Predict LSTM.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook to build and analyse model performance

## Requirements
*    Tensorflow (+Keras)
